    <p>For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? We don't have anything but happy trees here. It all happens automatically. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

    A thin paint will stick to a thick paint. Just relax and let it flow. That easy. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us.
    
    You have to allow the paint to break to make it beautiful. Let that brush dance around there and play. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Happy painting, God bless.
    
    You need the dark in order to show the light. No pressure. Just relax and watch it happen. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck.
    
    I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.
    
    Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. There are no limits in this world. You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Be brave.
    
    Just beat the devil out of it. This piece of canvas is your world. This is the fun part Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun Now it's beginning to make a little sense.
